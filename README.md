## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ChakraUI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) - For styles and components
- [React-Flip-Countdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@leenguyen/react-flip-clock-countdown) - For timer component

### What I learned

Well, for this challenge, another approach for responsive design, which is the utilization of viewport units (which is a controversial approach), but given the use case for this project. I wanted to explore another approach.

### Continued development

I would like to familiarize better with a mobile first development workflow, which I might implement, by development, either with ionic (angular) or react native.
